# Lesson 04 - DevSecOps: Principles and Practices

This repository explores the integration of security into the DevOps lifecycle, drawing from industrial philosophies like the Toyota Production System and Lean management to optimize software development value streams.

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives

* Understand **Value Streams** and their application to service delivery.
* Analyze the foundational philosophies of **Toyota Production System (TPS)**, **Lean**, and **Agile**.
* Implement the **Three Ways of DevSecOps** to improve flow, feedback, and continuous learning.


## 🛠️ Foundational Philosophies

### Toyota Production System (TPS)

A philosophy centered on eliminating waste to achieve the most efficient production methods while making work easier for employees.

- **Jidoka:** "Automation with a human touch".
- **Just-In-Time:** Producing only what is needed, when it is needed.


### Lean Management

Focused on maximizing customer value while minimizing waste.

- **Define Value:** Focus strictly on what solves the problem.
- **Map Value Streams:** Utilize tools like Kanban boards to make work visible.
- **Establish Flow:** Keep work batches small to prevent bottlenecks.


### Agile Methodology

A software development approach focused on rapid value delivery through iterative progress.

- **Key Values:** Prioritizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change over rigid processes or plans.


## 🔄 The Three Ways of DevSecOps

The application of manufacturing and leadership principles to the software development value stream is categorized into "Three Ways":

1. **The First Way (Flow):** Keep work batches small and visible to increase speed and innovation. This includes **Continuous Build, Test, Integration, Delivery, and Deployment**.
2. **The Second Way (Feedback):** Shorten the loop between development and deployment to accelerate problem detection and recovery. This involves **Continuous Monitoring** and baking observability into applications.
3. **The Third Way (Continuous Learning):** Foster a high-trust culture that encourages experimentation and learning from failure. This is achieved through **Continuous Improvement** and sprint retrospectives.


## 🧪 Practical Exercise: Morale-Boosting App

**Objective:** Create and containerize an application to boost team morale.

- **Requirement:** The app must be tested, containerized, and approved by a Team Lead.
- **Conditions:** Use GitHub for version control and any preferred code editor.
- **Reference:** Complete the exercise using [Coding Kata 1](https://github.com/afc-ai2c/coding-katas/).
