# Lesson 01 - Cloud Computing - Why Choose Cloud?

This repository contains educational materials focused on the fundamental concepts, benefits, and trade-offs of migrating business operations to cloud platforms.


## 🎯 Lesson Objectives

* Understand the **fundamental concepts** of cloud computing.
* Identify key **business drivers** for cloud migration.
* Analyze **economic and operational benefits**.
* Discuss real-world **case studies** of cloud success.


## ☁️ 5 Essential Characteristics

Cloud computing is defined by five core attributes:

1. **On-demand Self-service:** Provisioning services without human interaction from the provider.
2. **Ubiquitous Network Access:** Capability to access services over the network from anywhere.
3. **Location Transparent Resource Pooling:** Provider resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.
4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Ability to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand.
5. **Measured Service (Pay-per-Use):** Costs are based on actual usage rather than upfront investment.

## 🚀 Key Benefits

### Scalability

Cloud platforms offer two primary ways to handle growth:

- **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing the size/power (CPU, RAM) of an existing instance.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more instances to your infrastructure.


### Operational Agility

- **Global Accessibility:** Supports remote work and allows headquarters to be located anywhere.
- **Disaster Recovery:** The provider manages infrastructure recovery; operations can be shifted between regions easily.
- **Maintenance:** Physical maintenance is handled by the provider, and updates can be rolled out with zero downtime.


### Economic Impact

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **CapEx (Capital Expenses)** | Traditional upfront costs for physical hardware, depreciated over time.
| **OpEx (Operational Expenses)** | Cloud model of paying over time, taxed at the point of purchase.
| **Efficiency** | Reduced waste through better resource utilization.
| **Predictability** | Provides clear ROI/TCO calculations and predictable spending.


## ⚠️ Potential Downsides

While powerful, the cloud introduces specific challenges:

- **Dependency:** Requires constant internet connectivity.
- **Technical Limits:** Potential for latency and limited customization/flexibility.
- **Management:** Increased management complexity and the risk of **vendor lock-in**.
