# Write a program that calculates however many semiprime 
# numbers the user specifies and prints them to the screen.


# 1.  TODO Write a function that checks if a number is prime.


# 2.  TODO Write a function that checks if a number is the product of two primes.


# 3.  TODO Prompt the user for how many semiprime numbers they want.


# 4.1 TODO Create a loop that iterates on each number checking to see if its semiprime.
# 4.2 TODO Append the semiprimes to a list in the order you find them.
# 4.3 TODO Terminate the loop once the list's length is what the user asked for.


# 5.  TODO Print the list of semiprimes to the screen.
