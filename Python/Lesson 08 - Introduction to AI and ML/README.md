# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

This repository provides a foundational overview of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Data Science**, exploring their relationships, core lifecycles, and the critical role of ethics in modern technology.


## 🎯 Lesson Objectives

* Understand the relationships between **data science** and **artificial intelligence**.
* Explore different **types of models** and their various applications.
* Discuss **AI Ethics** and its necessity for responsible innovation.


## 🧬 Data Science and AI: How it Fits Together

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that extracts knowledge and insights from data using scientific methods, algorithms, and programming to inform decision-making.


### The Data Science Lifecycle

The process follows a structured, iterative approach:

1. **Problem Definition:** Understanding business/mission needs.
2. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Preparing raw data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Finding initial patterns and insights.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and transforming variables for models.
5. **Model Building & Evaluation:** Training algorithms and testing performance.
6. **Deployment & Monitoring:** Running models in production and maintaining them.


## 🤖 AI and Machine Learning

While often used interchangeably, these terms have distinct meanings within the technical stack.

- **Artificial Intelligence:** The broad concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.
- **Machine Learning:** A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.


## ⚖️ AI Ethics and Responsible Innovation

As AI systems become more integrated into society, understanding the ethical risks is paramount.

### Key Ethical Pillars

- **Bias:** Addressing systematic favoritism that leads to unfair results for certain groups.
- **Explainability:** Being transparent about how models make specific decisions.
- **Privacy:** The responsibility of protecting sensitive personal data.
- **Accountability:** Realizing and taking responsibility for the impact of ML models.
- **Misuse:** Understanding how AI technologies can be weaponized or used for harm.


## 🛠️ Essential Tools

- **Python:** The most popular language for AI due to its extensive library ecosystem.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn):** A popular ML library for Python that provides built-in models and integrates with data tools like NumPy and Pandas.
