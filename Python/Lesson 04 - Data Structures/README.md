# Data Structures Basics

This repository covers fundamental concepts and manipulation techniques for Python's built-in data structures, specifically focusing on **lists** and **tuples**. 


## 🎯 Lesson Objectives

* Understand the difference between **mutable and immutable** data structures. 
* Master basic **list manipulation** techniques. 
* Implement and navigate **nested lists** to represent complex data like arrays. 


## 🏗️ Mutable vs. Immutable

Python data structures are categorized by whether they can be changed after creation. 

- **Immutable (Tuples):** Once created, the elements and size cannot be changed.  These are useful for fixed data collections.
- **Mutable (Lists):** Can be modified by adding, removing, or changing elements.  These are the most flexible and commonly used structures for dynamic data.


## 📋 Lists and Tuples

### Initialization and Copying

- **Initialization:** Learning how to define these structures using `[]` for lists and `()` for tuples. 
- **Copying:** Understanding how to properly copy these structures to avoid unintended side effects when modifying data. 


### Basic Manipulation

Includes common operations such as:

* Adding elements to a list. 
* Removing or updating existing values. 
* Accessing data using index positions. 


## 🔲 Nested Lists

A nested list is a list that contains other lists as its elements. 

- **Arrays:** Nested lists are frequently used to represent multi-dimensional data, such as a 2D grid or a matrix. 
- **Accessing Data:** To retrieve data from a nested list, you use multiple indices (e.g., `matrix[row][column]`). 


## 🛠️ Hands-On Exercises

- **Hands-On #1:** Practice working with mutable and immutable structures to understand their distinct behaviors. 
- **Hands-On #2:** Implement nested lists to build and manipulate a basic data array.
